<!-- Please note, if you see the words "Brand Recognition Co." - note that this is a business that I'm creating that will
    design free websites for local businesses. I randomly included the name (Brand Recognition Co.) in this website's design as a vision board.
    Thus, in my first submitted assignment I forgot to remove the "Designed by Brand Recognition Co." in all the footers.

                                <p>During a brake check, our mechanics will carefully inspect all wearable parts including brake pads, brake discs and brake fluid. To check the brake pads and discs, specialist equipment will be used to take accurate measurements of these components. 
                                    <span class="read-more-text">If the measurements do not meet with those specified for the vehicle by the manufacturer, the parts will need to be replaced.
                                        The brake fluid will also be checked to determine whether it needs replacement due to ageing or contamination. 
                                        Following a brake check, you will be provided with a detailed report on the condition of your brakes together with a quotation for any work that might be required.
                                        All brake replacement parts and materials used are of high quality and in keeping with the manufacturer's requirements.</span>

                                <p>The check will begin with a visual assessment of the battery's physical condition. Any sign of damage is obviously a serious issue, but the Bosch Car Service engineer carrying out the battery check will also pay close attention to the terminals. 
                                    
                                    <span class="read-more-text">If these are corroded in any way, it may mean that the power cables will not be able to form a good connection. In that case, it's usually best to replace the battery.
                                        <br> <br> The next stage is to check whether voltage of the battery is high enough to start the car. At least 75% capacity is acceptable. But it is also important to check whether that battery can actually deal with the load imposed on it when it has to crank an engine. Specialist equipment can measure that very reliably.         
                                        <br> <br> Finally, it is necessary to check how well the battery charges. This is particularly important if it initially showed a low voltage - the charging test will determine whether that was a sign of problems or an effect of normal circumstances such as driving for a short period of time.</span>

                                <p>The real skill in tire fitting is seen in the wheel balancing and alignment processes. As you would expect, Bosch Car Service tire changers bring a high level of training and care to both activities. Balancing involves attaching weights to the rim of a wheel. 
                            
                                    <span class="read-more-text"> It is intended to ensure that the wheel has an even distribution of weight around its circumference. 
                                        <br> If you drive with poorly balanced wheels, you will experience a vibrating sensation and the tires will be harmed. Wheel alignment may also be recommended as part of a tire fitting, for example if the old tires had a characteristic wear pattern. You should also ask about it if your steering does not behave normally. When your wheels are aligned with care, you will almost certainly see an improvement in fuel economy as well.</span>
